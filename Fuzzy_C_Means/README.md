The [fuzzy c-means](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/539444) algorithm was derived in 1981 and has continued to be a well-used method within the machine learning community when the data is ambiguous.

This implementation of the algorithm always for any [LP metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space) in a Hilbert space and the [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) pseudometric. The KL divergence implementation applys a homeomorphic mapping of the n-dimensional data to a (n+1)-dimensional vector in the interior [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex). 

This algorithm is a numpy implementation, focusing on the linear algebra functions and broadcasting characteristic of numpy.
